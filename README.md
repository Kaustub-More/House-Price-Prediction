🏡 AI-Powered House Price Prediction

This repository showcases an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts real estate prices with high accuracy. Instead of just focusing on raw predictions, this project emphasizes data-driven insights, robust model training, and a production-ready web deployment.

🔥 Highlights

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Discovered market trends, correlations, and property value drivers.

🧹 Data Engineering: Handled missing values, outliers, skewed distributions, and scaled features for stability.

🤖 Modeling & Optimization:

Implemented Linear Regression as baseline.

Compared with advanced models (Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree) to ensure robustness.

Evaluated using RMSE, R² Score, and Cross-Validation.

🌐 Interactive Web App:

Built using Flask + Bootstrap.

Clean UI with real-time prediction based on user inputs (size, bedrooms, age).

🚀 Deployment:

Hosted on PythonAnywhere for live usage.

Ready-to-scale with Docker support for future cloud deployment.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Core: Python 3.10+, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree (expandable)

Web Framework: Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Deployment: PythonAnywhere (Docker-ready for AWS/Heroku)
